### Who am I and why do I like working with data? 👦
    
I'm Stefanos, I study economics and developed a major interest in statistics and econometrics throught my time at University. 

For me, where physics and mathematics help us understand the matter and universe surrounding us, statistics and data (also) give us an insight into our society and fellow human beings. 🤔

Society is one great puzzle and data gives us a sneak peek into the behavioural habits of individuals which can be understood by analysing data.
